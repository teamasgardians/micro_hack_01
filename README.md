The Waste Management Blockchain Network

Introduction : 
Management of waste materials has become one of the primary concerns of the 21st century. Solutions for recycling almost all of the biodegradable waste has been implemented but the case of non biodegradable waste still remains a problem. Even in situations where recycling of products are available, the problems like storage and acquisition of waste materials hinders the recycling process.

WasteCOIN

The network is built over blockchain technology, and which enables the public and decentralized storage of the details of the waste material provided and the rewards paid. 
The token pric is determined by the recycled counterpart of the waste material input.
 1. Higher the value of the material recycled, higher is his/her chance to decrypt the code and get the reward
        2. If higher toxic materials are recycled he/she get the reward


Animals(Forest)
	1. Animal extinction is hitting the life cycle dynamics, so linking those animals(in forest) for safety,
       	   helping find preys(based on the position/number of preys) for those animal, migrating to different places
       	   etc..
       	HOW?
          1. Fixing vibratory or some physical stimulation devices to those animals(this can be fixed without harming
            those species, like inpregnating IOT devices that draws charge from their body)
      	WHEN? 
          1. There is no question like when, all animals/birds living in the forest could be tracked by this method.
             So no WHEN...
       	WHERE?
          1. Almost all forest have some animals that are under extinction have some animals that are highly 
             important for the life cycle dynamics of the forest.
